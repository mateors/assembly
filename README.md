## Netwide Assembler - NASM
> Official website https://www.nasm.us

## What is NASM?
> NASM is An asssembler for the x86 CPU architecture portable to nearly every modern platform, and with code generation for many platforms old and new.

## What is asssembler?
> a program for converting instructions written in low-level symbolic code into machine code.

## What is QEMU?
> QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
> `https://www.qemu.org`

## What is GCC?
> The Gnu C Compiler (GCC) 

## What is DJGPP?
> GCC for DOS/Windows


## What is GRUB?
> Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) to load your kernel into memory.

## Pre-requisite
* X86 Assembler knowledge
* General knowledge of the C programming.

## What is the GDT?
> The GDT ("Global Descriptor Table") is a data structure used to define the different memory
areas: the base address, the size and access privileges like execute and write. These
memory areas are called "segments"

## What is Vagrant?
> Vagrant is free and open-source software for creating and configuring virtual
> development environments. It can be considered a wrapper around VirtualBox

### A Brief History of Operating Systems
> The first operating system was created by General Motors in 1956 to run a single IBM mainframe computer. Other IBM mainframe owners followed suit and created their own operating systems.

>In the 1960s, IBM was the first computer manufacturer to take on the task of operating system development and began distributing operating systems with their computers.

>However, IBM wasn’t the only vendor creating operating systems during this time. Control Data Corporation, Computer Sciences Corporation, Burroughs Corporation, GE, Digital Equipment Corporation, and Xerox all released mainframe operating systems in the 1960s as well.
