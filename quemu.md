## Show me golang example code how can i write a simple application which can run on QEMU

Sure, here is an example of a simple Go program that you can run on QEMU:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, QEMU!")
}
```

To run this program on QEMU, you will need to first install Go and QEMU on your system. Once you have those set up, you can compile the program using the go build command:

```
go build hello.go
```
This will create an executable binary file called hello in the current directory. You can then run the binary on QEMU using the following command:

```
qemu-arm ./hello
```
This will start QEMU and run the hello program inside it. You should see the output "Hello, QEMU!" printed to the console.

Note that the above example assumes that you are running QEMU in ARM mode. If you are running QEMU in a different mode (e.g. x86), you will need to specify the appropriate target architecture when compiling the Go program. You can do this by setting the GOARCH environment variable before running the go build command, e.g.

```
GOARCH=amd64 go build hello.go
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

## Give me an example how can i make an bootable image from an elf binary file for QEMU x86 architecture.
Sure, here is an example of how you can create a bootable image for QEMU x86 architecture using an ELF binary file:

First, you will need to install the xorriso utility, which is used to create bootable ISO images. On Debian-based systems, you can install xorriso using the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install xorriso
```

Next, create a directory called boot and copy your ELF binary file into it. This directory will be used to create the bootable image.

Create a file called grub.cfg in the boot directory with the following contents:

```
menuentry "My ELF Binary" {
    multiboot /boot/my_elf_binary.elf
}
```

This file tells GRUB, the bootloader that will be used in the bootable image, to display a menu entry called "My ELF Binary" and to load the my_elf_binary.elf file as the kernel when it is selected.

Run the following command to create the bootable image:
```
xorriso -as mkisofs -o bootable.iso -isohybrid-mbr /usr/lib/ISOLINUX/isohdpfx.bin -c boot/boot.cat -b boot/grub.efi -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table boot
```

This command creates an ISO image called bootable.iso that contains the boot directory and its contents. The -isohybrid-mbr option specifies that the image should contain a hybrid MBR, which allows it to be booted from either BIOS or UEFI systems. The -c boot/boot.cat and -b boot/grub.efi options tell GRUB to use the boot catalog and EFI boot image from the boot directory, respectively. The -no-emul-boot and -boot-load-size options disable emulation and set the boot load size, respectively.

You can now boot the image in QEMU using the following command:
```
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom bootable.iso
```

This will start QEMU and boot the image from the bootable.iso file. When the boot menu appears, select the "My ELF Binary" menu entry to boot the my_elf_binary.elf file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
