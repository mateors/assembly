This book is written for system designers, system integrators, and programmers who are designing or programming a System-on-Chip (SoC) that uses the Cortex-A53 processor.


> low-power processor that implements the Armv8-A architecture. The Cortex-A53 processor has one to four cores, each with an L1 memory system and a single shared L2 cache.

## SoC manufacturer = System on a Chip
its focus has been largely on mid- and low-end budget tablets, PMPs. and HDMI media sticks, and not so much on smartphones.
