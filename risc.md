# The ARM is what is called a RISC computer
> RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer
RISC is a type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small, highly-optimized set of instructions, rather than a more specialized set of instructions often found in other types of architectures. The goal of RISC architecture is to reduce execution time by simplifying the instruction set of the computer.
