## What is the future of Unikernels?

> Unikernels are a type of operating system that is designed to be highly specialized and run a single application or a small set of closely related applications. They are built from the ground up to be as small and efficient as possible, and they are typically deployed on specialized hardware or in virtualized environments.

> The future of unikernels is uncertain, as they have not gained widespread adoption in the market. Some experts believe that they have the potential to revolutionize the way that we build and deploy applications, particularly in the cloud, because of their small size, security, and efficiency. Others believe that they are niche technologies that will only be used in specialized cases.

> One potential use case for unikernels is in the Internet of Things (IoT) space, where their small size and low resource requirements make them a good fit for devices with limited resources. They may also be useful for running legacy applications that are difficult to port to modern operating systems, or for running applications in highly secure environments where minimizing the attack surface is a top priority.

> Overall, it is difficult to predict the future of unikernels with certainty, but they may continue to be developed and used in specialized cases where their unique characteristics are valuable.
